# **App Name**: RetroTerm

## Core Features:

- Text Scramble Animation: Show the name 'Vitaliy' using a text scramble animation when the page loads.
- Terminal Interface: Simulate a retro terminal interface with a blinking cursor and monospaced font.
- Navigation Buttons: Provide navigation buttons styled like old-school terminal commands for 'About,' 'Projects,' and 'Contact.'
- Service Categories: Display service categories as selectable options reminiscent of a command list in a terminal.
- Stack Display: Use Matter.js to create a dynamic stack of technology logos with a retro, blocky design, simulating falling blocks on a CRT screen.
- Stack Tilt Simulation: Use the gyroscope and accelerometer tool to control the simulated Stack. Allow for dynamic, user-controlled physics, and re-simulate if conditions change.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Deep black (#000000) to emulate a classic terminal screen.
- Primary color: Dark green (#006400) to give a retro terminal look.
- Accent color: A very light gray (#F0F0F0) will provide excellent contrast on the background and creates emphasis on important elements, maintaining readability.
- Font: 'Share Tech Mono' (monospace) for an authentic terminal appearance for all text.
- Use simple, geometric icons reminiscent of early computer interfaces, where applicable.
- Maintain a grid-based layout with pixel-perfect alignment to mimic the constraints of early computer displays.
- Implement simple, scanline-like effects, and a text printing effect for the terminal text, along with the animated stack of technology blocks to enhance the retro feel.
